DESCRIPTION:

KEEP IT SIMPLE is a clean and minimalist website template designed primarily for blog sites. 
The design does not use many images; it focuses more on content and typography. Keep It Simple 
is fully responsive, and scales gracefully from desktop computers down to the smallest mobile 
phone. Assets in high-resolution and vector format ensures that it looks sharp on retina screens.

SUPPORT:
    
Since KEEP IT SIMPLE is distributed for free, support is not offered. KEEP IT SIMPLE is coded according 
to current web standards and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify.
If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. 
However, If you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the 
following tutorials:

 - https://marksheet.io/
 - http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

These will teach you the essentials of HTML and CSS. In addition, if you want to include
jQuery in your skill-set, you can also check out these tutorials:
